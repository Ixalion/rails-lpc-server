# Rails LPC Server
This is an API accessible rails 5 server for generating and serving LPC sprite-sheets Edit

## Description
This is primarily being built as a baseline for tileserver to be used in a game
that I am currently working on. However this repo contains the base rails server
that contains the code needed to store, serve, and access the tilesheets is
being made open source so others may use it in their projects.

For the time being I am not intending on making the rest of application as
open-source. As such I will not be accepting contributions to this project
as I want to maintain sole copyright.

# AS SUCH PULL REQUESTS WILL BE IGNORED. IF YOU WANT TO DEVELOP ON THIS APPLICATION YOU WILL NEED TO CLONE THIS REPO.
